# Some database

We are going to create a relational database together.

In order to learn how to do it - our real objective - we are going to split
it into several versions. Each version will be available on a different git branch.

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [basic](https://github.com/tiagoantao/some-database/tree/basic) | Basic SQL with `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT` and `SELECT` |
