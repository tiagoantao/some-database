# Some database

We are going to create a relational database together.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the basic version. For all the other versions check the [main repository](../..)

## Intro

This version supports a basic `CREATE TABLE` along with `INSERT` and `SELECT` statements.

You can find all related tutorials and documentation on our [Substack](https://tiagoantao.substack.com/)

## Trying stuff

Have a look at the [example](example.py). Run it by doing

`uv run example.py`

The [TUI](tui.py) version can be run like this:

`uv run tui.py`
